Here you can copy an paste an url and know what is the size of your data. Then the page gives you a visual of your data, also it gives you a history of the url that you had search

# Objective

# Playing with the website

* The first thing that you have to refresh your browser, this is because sometimes the data that comes as default dont load.
Then the default data will load.

* In second place you are able to put your url from datos.gov.co in the first input of the website. then you have to put the size of the dataset you are uploading, this you can found it at the bottom of the page where you copi the API link from datos.gov.co at the section called "Vista previa de a tabla" you just have to look at the rigth bottom corner, there will be the size of the array.

### Very Important
     * You have to make a click on the green button of the page. If you push enter the app will not show anything.
     * Also the size of the dataset is very important without it the website would not recognize the data.
     
* Finally every time you enter to the page you can see all the history of the url that were consulted at the bottom of the website.
